<!--
* Promise - dynamic web applications without Javascript

* We'll walk through 4 real-world features that I've built in LiveView, bolting on increasing complexity

* We'll take a brief look at the testing infrastructure and syntax. My entire application's test suite takes less than 10 seconds. My entire application's test suite takes less than 4 seconds.
